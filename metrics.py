        a lower SSR means you had a worse sequence. Early bad returns are multiplied
        more often, reducing the overall SSR.

    From a forum discussion (https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=120430&start=600#p2940181):

    "Economists seem divided on what is a fair value to use for the coefficient of relative risk aversion.
    Based on my readings many seem to think it is the range 1 to 3 based on people's attitudes towards risk,
    however there are some who look at the asset allocation decisions people actually make that claim it must
    be 10 or more as a result."
