    "* It assumes an extremely liquid marketplace where there is no margin when selling. This is mostly truish for Treasuries, as well.\n",

    "* Real funds [shift their durations all the time][3], even if only by small amounts. Our simulated shifts and their actual shifts are unlikely to line up exactly.\n",

    "# Bond Mechanics\n",
    "\n",
    "A bond is just three things: a yield, a face value, and a maturity. If you called up your broker you would say, \"I want to buy $100 of the 10-year Treasury that is yielding 3.2%.\" The maturity is 10-years; the face value is $100; and the yield is 3.2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two things you can do with a bond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receive your payment\n",
    "Every year the bond will generate a payment -- a \"coupon\" in bond-speak. This is simply the **yield × face value**. Going back to the previous example, with a face value of $100 and a yield of 3.2%, every year you would get a payment of $3.20. (Not very impressive, admittedly.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check the current value of the bond\n",
    "Bonds are designed to be held until their maturity. At that point you'll receive a payment for the face value. In our example, that would mean after holding the bond for 10 years you would get your full $100 back.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you wanted to sell the bond **before** maturity? That's (usually) possible but the exact price will depend on current rates. Say we want to sell our bond after 9 years. In essence, we have a 1-year bond that yields 3.2%. What if the current going yield for 1-year bonds was 2.5%? Then our bond will be worth a little more. If the current going yield for 1-year bonds is 4.2% then our bond will be worth a little less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it actually gets calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* take the current maturity remaining on the bond\n",
    "* take the current yield on bonds of that maturity\n",
    "* take the bond face value\n",
    "\n",
    "Then mix all of them into present value calculation: **pv(current yield, current maturity, face value)**. (The pv function is found in every spreadsheet and many calculators.)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current yields are 2.5% and you have a face value of $100 then the present value is $97.56. This calculates the \"exact\" value of the bond. In the real world, someone would probably offer you slightly less, maybe $97.25, because they are offering you liquidity and taking some risk. For Treasuries that is a very small number, so ignoring it is probably good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From rates to returns\n",
    "At the end of the day, checking the current value of the bonds we hold is what we're trying to achieve. By adding up the value of all the bonds we hold we can figure out the Net Asset Value (NAV) of our fund. And then we compare that NAV over time. This is what we wanted: to be able to calculate the returns of a (simulated) bond fund."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But how do you get the ladder **started**? Where do those first bonds come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's where things get a little bit unavoidably hacky. In the real world, you could slowly build up a ladder over time. For instance, buy 1/10th of the ladder every year for a decade. That takes, well, a decade. Which means there's an entire decade in our simulation with no results. We can shortcut that at the cost of a slight loss of accuracy for those first few years.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we're building a 10-2 ladder then we have 9 bonds (we don't have a bond with 1-year maturity, hence only 9 bonds). We bootstrap the ladder by buying all 9 instantly. That means they will all have the same yield -- whatever the current yield is."

    "\n",
    "For a given year, we will have **some** rate data. At the very least we will have the 1-year and 10-year rates; the data on those go back the further thanks to Shiller.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we may *also* have other rate data from FRED.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we need to have rate data for every year on the yield curve. That is: 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 9-, and 10-year rates. When we don't have the data available we will perform linear interpolation from data we *do* have to fill in the gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we only have the 1- and 10-year data then we need to do a linear interpolation for the other 8 years. If we have 1-, 3-, and 10-year data then we do linear interpolation between the 1- and 3-year data to fill in the 2-year data. And we'll do linear interpolation between the 3- and 10-year data for the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing data & flat yield curve\n",
    "\n",
    "We can only do linear interpolation if we have two sets of data. We *always* have data for 1-year and 10-year rates, so we can fill in that part of the yield curve. But before the FRED data series of the mid-20th century we don't have any rates beyond 10 years. How do we fill that part of the rate yield curve when we don't have anything to interpolate?\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't interpolate: we just create a flat yield curve. That is, the 11-year rate is the same as the 10-year rate. And the 20-year rate is *also* the same as the 10-year rate. And the 30-year rate is **also** the same as the 10-year rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is obviously far from idea. So you should take with a large grain of salt any results before 1954. longinvest has [some comments on the longer terms starting approximately here][2].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential problems with linear interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "This linear interpolation is not perfect: it assumes that the yield curve is linear and that may not be the case. In particular, [look at this post from Fryxell][1] where he notes that before the 1920s the yield curve may have looked very different from what it did today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, trying to handle that is beyond the scope of this simulation. The more historical data (like those extra FRED data points) that we have, the less of this linear interpolation we need to do. That makes our post-1954 numbers better than the earlier numbers.\n",
